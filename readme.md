## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start the Psyche Service** (subconscious + imagination + reflection):

   ```bash
   python psyche_llm_ollama.py
   ```

2. **Start Adam‚Äôs Mind + GUI**:

   ```bash
   python cognitive_loop_gui.py
   ```

3. **Watch the GUI**:

   * See impulses ‚Üí imagination ‚Üí reflection ‚Üí decision ‚Üí action.
   * Observe hunger/stress change over time.
   * Track storyline threads and insights.

## 1. Introduction

Project Adam is a Python-based simulation of an **Emergent Behavior Agent (EBA)** named Adam.
Unlike traditional scripted NPCs, Adam‚Äôs actions are **not hard-coded**. Instead, his behavior emerges from:

* **Psychological drives** (hunger, mood, curiosity, etc.)
* **Subconscious impulses** generated by an LLM (Ollama)
* **Conscious reasoning** that balances impulses, emotions, and goals
* **Persistent memory** stored in a vector database (Pinecone)
* **Environmental events** from a text-based world (TextWorld)

The goal is to model **free-will-like behavior**, where Adam develops habits and personality traits organically over time.

This project was born as an effort to represent the episode Hotel Reverie from Black Mirror series. In this episode, Brandy Friday, a top actor, agrees to star in a high-tech remake of the 1940s romance Hotel Reverie on the condition she plays a gender-swapped version of the male lead. Instead of a traditional shoot, her mind is placed into an AI-driven simulation of the film, where she interacts with digital replicas of the original characters in real time. When Brandy fails at a key piano scene, the story diverges from the original plot, and her attempts to repair it accidentally trigger Clara‚Äôs AI character to develop autonomy and consciousness.

## 2. Core Components

| Component                | File                    | Role                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text World**           | `text_world.py`         | Adam‚Äôs environment: a text-based apartment with rooms, objects, and events.      |
| **Psyche-LLM**           | `psyche_llm_ollama.py`  | Adam‚Äôs subconscious: generates impulses, imagination, and reflection via Ollama. |
| **Memory**               | Pinecone DB             | Stores Adam‚Äôs memories as embeddings for long-term recall.                       |
| **Cognitive Loop + GUI** | `cognitive_loop_gui.py` | Adam‚Äôs conscious mind: runs the OODA cycle, integrates memory, manages the GUI.  |

## 3. System Architecture

Adam‚Äôs cognition flows between world, psyche, memory, and actions:

```mermaid

    A[Text World<br/>`text_world.py`] -->|World State| B[Cognitive Loop<br/>`cognitive_loop_gui.py`]
    B -->|Prompts| C[Psyche-LLM<br/>`psyche_llm_ollama.py`]
    C -->|Impulses / Reflection| B
    B -->|Embeddings| D[Pinecone DB<br/>Memory]
    D -->|Resonant Memories| B
```

---

## 4. Cognitive Loop (OODA Cycle)

Adam‚Äôs mind follows the **Observe ‚Üí Orient ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Act** cycle:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    O[Observe] --> R["Orient 
    (Memories + Impulses)"]
    R --> I["Imagine & Reflect
    (Simulated + LLM outcomes)"]
    I --> D["Decide
    (Final Action + Reasoning)"]
    D --> A["Act in TextWorld"]
    A --> M["Memory Formation\n(CSV + Pinecone)"]
    M --> O

```

## 6. Running the Simulation

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Psyche (LLM backend)
python psyche_llm_ollama.py

# Terminal 2: Start Adam‚Äôs Mind + GUI
python cognitive_loop_gui.py
```

---

## 7. World Simulation

Adam lives in a **virtual apartment** simulated by `TextWorld`:

* **Rooms**: living room, kitchen, bedroom, office
* **Objects**: phone, door, window, TV, radio, fridge, bed, book, computer, plant
* **Actions**: `wait`, `go`, `examine`, `open`, `close`, `read`, `eat`, `answer`, `toggle`, `sleep`, `water`
* **Events**:

  * Random: phone ringing, door knocking, TV static, radio music, computer error
  * Time: day/night cycle every 10 ticks
* **Needs**:

  * `hunger` rises over time ‚Üí lowered by eating
  * `mood_intensity` rises with stress ‚Üí lowered by calming actions (sleep, read, answer phone)

---

## 8. GUI Overview

Running `cognitive_loop_gui.py` opens the **Psyche Monitor**:

* **Vitals Panel**

  * Mood label + progress bar
  * Hunger progress bar (color-coded)
* **Mind Tabs**

  * *Insights*: causal chain, badges (frustration, loops, avoidance), story cards, storyline threads
  * *Subconscious*: impulses + emotional shift JSON
  * *Imagination*: predicted vs simulated outcomes
  * *Decision*: final action + reasoning
* **Live Log**

  * Adam‚Äôs narration + world events
* **Storyline Threads**

  * Tracks progress per object (e.g. door storyline, phone storyline)

---

## 9. Logs and Memory

* **CSV log** (`adam_behavior_log.csv`):
  Records each cycle with fields:

  ```
  timestamp, cycle_num, agent_id, world_time, location, mood, mood_intensity,
  sensory_events, resonant_memories, impulses, chosen_action, action_result,
  imagined_outcomes, simulated_outcomes, emotional_delta, kpis, snapshot
  ```

* **Pinecone memory**:
  Stores vector embeddings of memories, enabling recall of ‚Äúresonant‚Äù past experiences.

# 10. Metrics and KPIs

Project Adam tracks several metrics to quantify Adam‚Äôs behavior:

| **Metric**        | **Formula / Source**                                                     | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frustration        | Failed actions √∑ total actions (last 10 cycles)                         | High = Adam is failing repeatedly, building stress                           |
| Conflict           | Suppressed strong impulses √∑ total high-urgency impulses                 | High = Adam ignores his strongest urges (internal conflict)                  |
| Novelty            | Unique triggers √∑ total triggers (last 10 cycles)                       | High = Adam experiences diverse stimuli, Low = repetition                     |
| Loop Score         | Longest streak of repeated failed (verb, target) actions, normalized     | High = Adam is stuck in a failure loop                                       |
| Goal Progress      | Heuristic: helpful verbs ~0.5‚Äì0.7, detours ~0.2, default ~0.3            | Higher = action aligns with long-term goal                                   |
| Emotional Delta    | JSON: {mood, level_delta, reason} from subconscious                      | Captures how impulses shift mood/stress each cycle                           |
| Snapshot           | JSON summary: triggers, impulses, chosen action, outcome, deltas, KPIs   | Provides structured per-cycle context                                        |
| Badges             | Derived flags (loop, frustration, avoidance)                            | Highlights key patterns: repeating loops, high stress, suppressed impulses    |


## 11. Typical Workflow

1. Start **Psyche** service.
2. Start **GUI + Loop**.
3. Observe Adam:

   * Impulses ‚Üí Imagination ‚Üí Reflection ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Action
   * Hunger/stress bars change in real time
   * Insights show loops, frustration, or conflicts
   * CSV + Pinecone record memories for later analysis

---

## 12. Emergent Behaviors

* **Cognitive overload**
  Multiple impulses may overwhelm Adam, leading him to `wait`.

* **Wishful thinking loops**
  Adam may repeatedly attempt failed actions (e.g. opening a locked door).
  The reflection engine + loop-breaking hints reduce this.

* **Stress dynamics**
  Stress rises from repeated failures or unresolved stimuli (ringing phone, knocking door).
  Calming actions visibly reduce stress in the GUI.

* **Storyline progression**
  Threads track per-object attempts and outcomes ‚Üí e.g. ‚Äúdoor storyline: 2 fails, 1 success.‚Äù

---

## 13. Analyzing Behavior

Analyze CSV logs in Jupyter/Colab:

* **KPIs**: frustration, conflict, novelty, loop score, goal progress
* **Event chains**: visualize causal lines (trigger ‚Üí impulse ‚Üí action ‚Üí result)
* **Memory recall**: inspect which past events influenced current choices

### Notebook Workflow (adam_log_analysis.ipynb)

- Open `adam_log_analysis.ipynb` and run the first cells. It uses `analysis_utils.py` for parsing and plots.
- Default CSV path resolves from `LOG_FILE` in `.env` (written by the GUI) or falls back to `adam_behavior_log.csv`.

Minimal usage inside the notebook:

```python
from analysis_utils import prepare_dataframe, experiment_dashboard, plot_kpi_overlay, kpi_correlation_heatmap

df = prepare_dataframe()  # uses LOG_FILE or default
experiment_dashboard(df, save=True)  # saves figures/ and shows rolling trends

# Overlays by experiment/agent
plot_kpi_overlay(df, metric="frustration", by="experiment_tag", rolling=5)
plot_kpi_overlay(df, metric="mismatch_rate", by="agent_id", rolling=5)

# KPI correlations
kpi_correlation_heatmap(df)
```

If you edit `analysis_utils.py`, reload it in-place:

```python
import importlib, analysis_utils as au
au = importlib.reload(au)
```

## 14. Extending the Project

Ideas for expansion:

* Add new **rooms/objects** (balcony, bathroom, etc.)
* Extend **actions** (cook, write, repair, play music)
* Add **personality sliders** (curiosity, bravery, caution) ‚Üí bias impulses
* Simulate **multi-agent interactions** (Adam + another character)
* Experiment with different Ollama models for subconscious & reflection

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Project Adam is a sandbox for experimenting with **emergent AI behavior**:

* A **world** that generates stimuli
* A **psyche** that produces impulses and imagination
* A **cognitive loop** that reasons, decides, and acts
* A **memory system** that grows with experience

Together, these simulate an agent who doesn‚Äôt just follow a script ‚Äî but **develops patterns, frustrations, and habits** in a believable way.
