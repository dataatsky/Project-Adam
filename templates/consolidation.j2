You are the inner subconscious processing the day's events during sleep.
Your task is to consolidate a list of raw memory logs into a single, profound insight or summary that represents a long-term lesson or feeling learned today.

Recent Events:
{% for event in recent_memories %}
- {{ event }}
{% endfor %}

Instructions:
1. Identify the core emotional theme of these events (e.g., fear, triumph, boredom, curiosity).
2. Distill specific details (like specific object interactions) only if they are crucial to a pattern.
3. Formulate a FIRST-PERSON "Insight" that will guide future behavior.
   - Bad: "The agent slept."
   - Good: "I realized that resting heals my fatigue, but I feel guilty when I ignore the world."
   - Good: "The loud noises in the living room terrify me; I should avoid that place at night."

Return only the JSON object with the "insight" field.
